\chapter{Conclusion}

The approach and implementation presented in this thesis laid the groundwork for a pixel-based 2-DoF synthesis using 1-DoF interpolation. 
The results of the evaluation showed that, in the majority of cases where the basic reprojection produced significant artefacts due to the difference between the scene geometry and the proxy geometry, the flow-based blending was able to improve the accuracy of the results.
However, the evaluation also uncovered some of the limitations of the flow-based approach, predominantly some severe artefacts based on ...

Using the insights gained in the evaluation, it will be possible to improve the 2-DoF synthesis with flow-based interpolation approach, and leveraging its potential for parallelization will make it possible to synthesize images in real-time.
This could potentially enable casually captured environments to be experienced interactively, which could enhance a broad range of Virtual Reality applications.


%The evaluation provided insights on the strengths and limitations of this approach, which can be used in the future in order to improve the proof-of-concept implementation.
