\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

The approach and implementation presented in this thesis laid the groundwork for a pixel-based 2~DoF synthesis using 1~DoF interpolation in order to apply flow-based blending. The 
In order to improve this approach for use in actual Virtual Reality applications, the artefacts created by the flow-based approach could be improved by either adding a constraint to the viewpoint selection, or by increasing the accuracy of the proxy geometry. The implementation could then be optimized in a way that would enable real-time navigation of previously captured scenes with 2 DoF, which could be used to inhance a number of Virtual Reality applications.
