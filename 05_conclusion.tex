\chapter{Conclusion}

The approach and implementation presented in this thesis laid the groundwork for a pixel-based 2-DoF synthesis using 1-DoF interpolation, which combines
straightforward, pixel-based reprojection using proxy geometry with flow-based interpolation in order to generate more accurate results.
The evaluation provided insights on the strengths and limitations of this approach, which can be used in the future in order to improve the proof-of-concept implementation.
On the basis of the approach developed in this thesis,
%real-time navigation of previously captured scenes with 2 DoF , which could be used to experience
casually captured environments could be experienced interactively, which could enhance a broad range of Virtual Reality applications.
