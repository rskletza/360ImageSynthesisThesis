\chapter{Results and Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item different datasets: checkersphere, virtual room, real data
  \item use evaluation in order to determine the effect of the different parameters on quality? \ar relative quality
  \item use evaluation to determine optimal parameters, especially weight
\end{itemize}

Parameters that (may) have an effect on quality
\begin{itemize}
  \item distance between captures / ``resolution'' of captures
  \item distance of scene from model (checkersphere, square room, arbitrary room) and accuracy of closest radius (were captures actually taken near edges of the scene?)
  \item accuracy of capture locations
  \item weight function
  \item actual distance from scene to viewpoint (are there objects close to the camera)
\end{itemize}
